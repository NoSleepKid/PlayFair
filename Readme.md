# PlayFair - ReadMe

## Error Codes
- "FAIR" This means that the scene that loads PlayFair has already been loaded once and has prevented from 2 or more instances from existing.
- "WTRMELON" This means that the developer of the game has failed to successfully implement the IPlayFairInitCallback interface into their project.
- "CHILDREN KILLED" This means that all of the children of the PlayFair object have been destroyed. Usually, this happens when someone didn't implement PlayFair into their game correctly, or when someone is using mods, MelonLoader, and/or BepInEx.
- "RESPOND PLEASE" This happens when a part of PlayFair times out during its self-check. Usually, this occurs when 1 or 2 child objects of PlayFair have been destroyed.
- "UNITYENGINE" This happens when the Unity version is less than Unity 2017.2. If you receive this, please contact the developer of this game with the error code or upgrade it yourself.
- "FAST" This happens when the time scale is greater than 1. PlayFair is not designed for this scenario.

### Overview
PlayFair is a robust, developer-friendly system designed to maintain fairness and detect unusual behavior in your games. Developed by **NoSleepKid** from **NukStudios**, PlayFair ensures that your players enjoy a cheat-free gaming experience without any integration of PlayFabâ€”this is a fully original system.

### Features
- **Anti-Cheat Detection**:
  - Detects auto-clickers.
  - Identifies non-human mouse movements.
  - Monitors unnatural keyboard typing patterns.
- **Callback-Driven Architecture**:
  - Customizable callbacks for handling detected cheats.
  - Interfaces for seamless integration into your game logic.
- **Developer-Friendly**:
  - Simple setup with minimal configuration.
  - Expandable and modifiable for personal use.

### Getting Started
1. **Import PlayFair into Your Project**:
   - Add the PlayFair script(s) to your project.

2. **Attach the PlayFair Component**:
   - Add the `PlayFair` MonoBehaviour to a GameObject in your scene.
   - Use the `DontDestroyOnLoad` pattern to keep PlayFair persistent.

3. **Implement Interfaces**:
   - To receive callbacks, create a MonoBehaviour that implements one or more PlayFair interfaces:
     - `IOnPlayFairInitCallback`: Notifies when PlayFair initialization is complete.
     - `IPlayFairCheatCallbacks`: Handles cheat detection events.

Example:
```csharp
public class CheatDetectionHandler : MonoBehaviour, IPlayFairCheatCallbacks
{
    public void OnAutoClickerDetected()
    {
        Debug.Log("Auto-clicker detected! Taking action.");
    }

    public void OnNonHumanoidMouseMovementsDetected()
    {
        Debug.Log("Non-human mouse movements detected!");
    }

    public void OnNonHumanoidKeyboardTypingDetected()
    {
        Debug.Log("Unnatural keyboard typing detected!");
    }
}
```

4. **Initialization**:
   - PlayFair automatically finds objects implementing `IOnPlayFairInitCallback` during startup and calls `OnPlayFairInitComplete()`.

---

### Interfaces
#### `IOnPlayFairInitCallback`
- Callback for when PlayFair finishes initializing.
```csharp
void OnPlayFairInitComplete();
```

#### `IPlayFairCheatCallbacks`
- Callbacks for detecting specific cheats.
```csharp
void OnAutoClickerDetected();
void OnNonHumanoidMouseMovementsDetected();
void OnNonHumanoidKeyboardTypingDetected();
```

- **Modifications**:
  - You are welcome to modify PlayFair for personal use.
  - Please do not sell modified versions or claim ownership.
- **Support**:
  - For help or suggestions, contact us on Discord.
- **Naming Clarification**:
  - "PlayFair" does not reference PlayFab. Any resemblance is purely coincidental.
